Product of my final CIS 162 project. What needed to be a simple text-
based adventure came that I went a little above and beyond. It's now an
incredibly difficult puzzle that must be solved through trial and error
(not exactly, every hint to solve the game is in fact in the game, but
nobody who has played it yet has had the patience to find out what these
hints are, can you be the first?)
